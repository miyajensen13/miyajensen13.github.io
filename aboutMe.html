        <p>
            In her free time, she loves to eat out at different restaurants with her husband, teach herself how to paint, tend to her plants, play with her cats, learn how to make foods she never made before, swim at the pool with her son, lift weights because it makes her feel like a beast, listen/dance/sing to BTS, eat boba with her best friends, explore different makeup looks, surf when she's visiting home, and spend quality time with those she loves most.
